Azure API Key Guidance
----------------------------

The current version of the MAP Creation Tool uses Azure Maps for its base map. To enable the this feature, an API key must be generated by each individual user if a personal deployment of the tool is desired. By default, we recommend securing your API keys according to the official instructions on [Azure Maps security guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/authentication-best-practices). Enabling security will ensure no bad actors will be able to abuse the use of your personal API keys.

In case the tool will not be publically available, the security feature does not need to be enabled. However, it is still recommended to periodically check the usage of your keys.

### **Getting a Azure API Key**

An account with Azure and an API Key can be created using the [Azure Maps Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/quick-demo-map-app#create-an-azure-maps-account).

### **Using your API Key**

Once a key is obtained, please insert your key to the end of the Geocomplete src link (indicated by "azure.map.api.key") at the [application.properties](/fedgov-cv-map-services-proxy/src/main/resources/application.properties#L1). file and build your updated ConnectedVCS Tools using either the [Local](/docs/Local_Instructions.md) or [Docker](/docs/Docker_Instructions.md) build instructions.
