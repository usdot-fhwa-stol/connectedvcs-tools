Esri API Key Guidance
----------------------------

The current version of the MAP Creation Tool uses Esri's ArcGIS Location Services to calculate elevation. To enable the this feature, an API key must be generated by each individual user if a personal deployment of the tool is desired. By default, we recommend securing your API keys according to the official instructions on [Esri ArcGIS Platform security guidance](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/security-and-authentication/security-best-practices/). Enabling security will ensure no bad actors will be able to abuse the use of your personal API keys.

In case the tool will not be publically available, the security feature does not need to be enabled. However, it is still recommended to periodically check the usage of your keys.

### **Getting a Esri API Key**

An account with Esri and an API Key can be created using the [ArcGIS Location Platform](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/security-and-authentication/get-started/).

### **Using your API Key**

Once a key is obtained, please insert your key to the end of the Geocomplete src link (indicated by "esri.map.api.key") at the [application.properties](/fedgov-cv-map-services-proxy/src/main/resources/application.properties#L1). file and build your updated ConnectedVCS Tools using either the [Local](/docs/Local_Instructions.md) or [Docker](/docs/Docker_Instructions.md) build instructions.
