Bing Maps API Key Guidance
----------------------------

**NOTE: Bing Maps is now deprectated. We will be migrating to a different map provider.**

The current version of the MAP Creation Tool uses Bing Maps for its base map. An API key must be generated by each individual user if a personal deployment of the tool is desired. By default, we recommend securing your API keys according to the official instructions on [Enhanced Security for Bing Maps API Keys](https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2018-05/Announcing-Enhanced-Security-for-Bing-Maps-API-Keys). Enabling security will ensure no bad actors will be able to abuse the use of your personal API keys.

In case the tool will not be publically available, the security feature does not need to be enabled. However, it is still recommended to periodically check the usage of your keys. 

### **Getting a Bing Maps API Key**

An account with Bing Maps can be created using the [Bing Maps Portal](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/). After an account is created, you may follow the official instructions on [Creating a Bing Maps Key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key).

### **Using your API Key**

Once a key is obtained, please insert your key and any arbitrary username in the [ISDcreator-webapp-keys](/private-resources/js/ISDcreator-webapp-keys.js) file and build your updated ConnectedVCS Tools using either the [Local](/docs/Local_Instructions.md) or [Docker](/docs/Docker_Instructions.md) build instructions.
