**Epic MAP-171: Add Geometry Container to RGA Message**  

**Summary:**  Below are the Updates made under this Epic:
  - **RGA Geometry Container Integration with JNI:** Introduced Java classes and an updated RGA JNI wrapper required to support mandatory and optional fields of the Geometry Container for RGA Geometry Container.  

  - **RGA Geometry Container Integration with Message Builder:** Implemented mandatory and optional fields for the RGA Geometry Container in the MAP Tool message builder. Test cases were updated, and bugs were resolved. 

  - **Addition of Time Restrictions to Lane Info Configuration and Encoder:** For RGA messages, lane-level time restrictions can be specified that includes days of the week, start date, end date, as well define time period as day or night. To support this, UI is updated with time restrictions in lane info configuration. 

  - **Implementation of Esri Elevation API:** Replaced Google elevation API with Esri elevation API to retrieve elevation relative to ellipsoid.

**Epic MAP-209: Update Base Maps**  

**Summary:** The implementation of Map Tool has been using Bing Maps as the base tile set provider, which is planned for retirement in June 2025. This epic involves migrating to Azure Maps to ensure continued platform support, improved performance. 

Map Tool also uses OpenLayers 2, which is outdated and incompatible with modern JavaScript standards. Now, we upgraded the mapping library to OpenLayers 10.4.0. The migration requires full refactoring of the map interaction logic, layers, controls, and event handling to align with the modular architecture of the latest version. This upgrade is critical for long-term maintainability, browser compatibility, and performance optimization. 

Note: Since we updated Openlayers library from v2 to v10, a mismatch is introduced with lat/lon between v2 and v10 after 7 decimal points (~1mm difference) and this happens because of changes to the internal projection library used by the two versions.

Version 2.0.2, released Nov 8th, 2024
----------------------------------------

### **Summary**
This Hotfix 2.0.2 focuses on addressing tileAge data displayed on the MAPTool ISD map which was updated every time when user zoom in/out, move around a map in Map tool websites. Allowing these calls at the current rate is expected to prematurely exhaust the current Bing API key.


**<ins>Fixes:</ins>** 
- Removed tileAge API calls to bing maps. NOTE: tile age will no longer be available to users of the current MAP Tool.

**<ins>Fixes:</ins>** 
- Epic 203 Implement ConnectedVCS Tool Security Fixes:  Investigation revealed that ConnectedVCS ISD Tool could no longer load map tiles from Bing due to Bing API keys being suspended due to abnormal usage. The changes included below were applied to the webappopen.connectedvcs.com and webapptest.connectedvcs.com (test site). 
   - Implementing backend monitoring of API calls 

   - Switching to Google Maps API for elevation data

Version 2.0.0, released April 25th, 2024
----------------------------------------

### **Summary**

In this release, the MAP (also known as ISD) tool packages have been updated to use the open-source ASN1C compiler. These updates are validated with new and enhanced unit tests. UI updates include the removal of TIM and Message Validator buttons from the landing page, along with updated text in the ASN.1 text box of the MAP tool. After removing all traces of the proprietary tool, a public GitHub repository was created to release the code. All code has been added to this new repo, the README has been updated with build instructions, and the CI/CD pipeline has been revised. Lastly, a production environment has been established, and the code is now live at https://webappopen.connectedvcs.com. 

This release of the Map Tool introduces several significant updates:

- **<ins> Integration of Open-Source ASN1C Compiler:</ins>** After integrating the open-source ASN1c compiler, the message-builder and map-encoder packages have been updated to support all mandatory and selected optional intersection fields used in the existing MAP tool.

- **<ins> Enhanced Testing:</ins>** Added and updated unit tests for message-builder and map-encoder to cover the new functionalities.

- **<ins> Server Logs:</ins>** The message builder package now logs the generated MAP message and its encoded hex string to a server-side file for further verification purposes.

- **<ins> UI Adjustments:</ins>**
    - Removed buttons for TIM and message validator from the landing page as these features are not implemented in this version.
    - Updated the ASN.1 text box in the MAP tool to reflect that it will not be populated in this release.

- **<ins> Removal of Proprietay Components:</ins>** All components of the proprietary tool have been removed.

- **<ins> Repository and CI/CD Updates:</ins>**
    - Created the connectedvcs-tools GitHub repository in preparation for public release.
    - Updated the README file with command line build instructions.
    - Enhanced GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows to include a sonar scanner for source code analysis.

- **<ins> Production Environment:</ins>** Established a production environment based on the connectedvcs-tools (MAP tool, etc.) GitHub repository. The production site is now live at https://webappopen.connectedvcs.com.

Known Issues related to this release:

- **<ins>Partial Implementation of ASN1C:</ins>** The open-source ASN1C compiler has been integrated only within the  MAP tool. Features such as TIM and Message Validator remain disabled pending further updates. The original implementation of the CVCS Tools is still available and accessible at https://www.webapp.connectedvcs.com.
